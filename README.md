Description


Super Nova Fashion Clothings

Objective :

To work with "Routing" along with components in React JS.

Scenario :


One of the most prestigious apparel stores, SuperNova fashion clothings, has chosen to build its purchasing page on React JS. Create a navigation bar for this application that allows users to switch between View Cart and Display Products.

1. App Component

File: App.js

Refer the screenshot 1 and design the App component with a list of two links: Display Products and View Cart.

Structure:

Nova_diagram

Styling:


1. The <div> tag should have the below styles:

(i) Minimum height must be 950px and it's background image must have linear-gradient(to bottom, #0052b0, #520f41) as its value.

2.  Link tag(style: link2) for View Cart must should have the below style:

(i) Size of the font must be 1.3em

3. Link tag(style: link1) for Display Products must should have the below styles:

(i) Size of the font must be 1.3em

(ii) Left side Margin must be 1.25%

Routing configuration

Link

Router path

Route To

Display Products

/displayProducts

DisplayProducts Component

View Cart

/viewCart

ViewCart Component


On clicking the Display Products link, it should route to the DisplayProducts Component

On clicking the View Cart link, it should route to ViewCart Component.

Screenshot 1





2. DisplayProducts Component

Design the DisplayProducts component with the below requirement.

File: DisplayProducts.js

Design constraints:

All the available products must appear on the web page, as shown in screenshot 2

Perform the iterations for the products.

[List of products are fetched from products.json file and it is imported which you can make use of it directly]

Implementation:

Created component named "DisplayProducts".

a) Iterate the productList using map within div tag

b) Within map, function with product and index as it's arguments should return another div tag as follows:

Tag Name

Key attribute's Value

Style attribute's value

div

Product's id

styles.dt


c) Structure to be followed inside div tag is placed below





Tag Name

Label Name

Value

Style attribute's value

dl





fontWeight:"500"

dt

Product id:

{product.id}

styles.dt

dd

Title:

{product.title}

styles.label

dd

Price:

{product.price}

styles.label

dd

Available Size:

{product.availableSizes}

styles.label

dd>button

Add To Cart

-

styles.button


d) Available size must use map and should return 'td' tag within which size of the product must be displayed.

e) Tag 'button' must include onclick event whose value should be {this.cartHandler.bind(this,index)}

f) cartHandler method must invoke addToCart function which is present inside Service.js


Styling:

Consider "styles" as constant which holds the following styles:

1. The label tag should have the below styles:

(i) Weight of the font must be 600

(ii) Text color must be #D0F0C0

2. The dt tag that iterates the cart list must use the following styles:

(i) Color must be #000000

(ii) Weight of the font must be 700

(iii) Background color must be #D1C1F8

3. The paragraph tag should have the below styles:

(i) Weight of the font must be 700

(ii) Color must be #FFA07A

4. The button tag should have the below styles:

(i) Left side of the margin must be 77.50%


Screenshot 2




3. ViewCart Component

Design the ViewCart component with the below requirement.

File: ViewCart .js


Design constraints:

Products which are added to cart must be displayed on the web page, as shown in Screenshot 4.


Styling:

Consider "styles" as constant which holds the following styles:

1. The h2 tag should have the below styles:

(i) Weight of the font must be 650 and it's text should be aligned center.

(ii) Text color must be #FFA07A.

2. The <dt> tag should have the below styles:

(i) Weight of the font must be 700.

(ii) Color must be #ffffff.

3. The <dl> tag should have the below styles:

(i) Weight of the font must be 500.

Implementation:

a) Method viewCart must be invoked and it's returned value must be stored in the variable 'products'.

b) ViewCart component must return the div tag.

c) If there is no product added to the cart, then "There are no items in the Cart list that can be shown." must be displayed as <h2> tag. [Refer screenshot 3]

d) If not, then iterate the products using map and return the div which in turn consists of dl, dt, and dd tags.[Refer screnshot 4]

Tag Name

Label Name

Value

Style attribute's value

dl





styles.dl

dt

Product id:

{product.id}

dd

Title:

dd

Price:

<dl> tag must have key attribute whose value must be the id of the product.

Screenshot 4:



4. Service

File: Service.js

Implementation: This Service.js file has two functions namely, addToCart and viewCart [Provided as template]

(i) addToCart(index): When the "Add To Cart" button is clicked, this function must push the product into the cartList(already given) and display the alert message "Product has been added to your cart."
